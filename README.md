Topic modeling-TF-IDF-LDA algorithms
Explored advanced techniques for extracting key concepts from scientific literature, focusing on improving accuracy and efficiency. Working with dataset of over 600 publications and applied TF-IDF and LDA algorithms to create topic modeling from scientific papers. In Copy of _Streamlined Dataset_pF you can add your list of scientific papers with given years, abstract notes etc. Once you set up your environment and run the code, after choosing the header (by default it is 5 = runs first 5 papers), your outputs will be in hybrid_concepts_output_limited.

There are 2 outputs given hybrid and weighted key concepts. Weighted shows the likelihood the topic model is close to real topic model.
